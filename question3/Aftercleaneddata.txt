- ood upgrade from 
- irst of all super fast delivery i ordered the phone at around am and was unboxing it by pm on the same da
- econdly i exchanged my old moto g for this phone so got a great discount to
- t is a great phone for its price range and that is what made me hang on to my moto g until now when i found i the right upgrad
- s of now i got a chance to test the camera and the pictures have come out great both in low light and during the da
- he flash upgrade has helpe
- he phone is fast and apps do not have any la
- used to face a lag for certain large games on he g but dont seem to face any of that on this phone ye
- ould recommend this phone to anyone any da
- y only concern is that flipkart could have taken the old phone after a day as they charge you for pickup anyway as it would have given a chance to try out moto migrate between the two phone
- ertified buye
- uy it for a smooth experience not for flaunting spec
- have updated my experience after days of usage at the botto
- have been using an xperia high end and shifted to moto 
- am a moderate intensity user with majority usage in communication apps no major gaming usage as soon as moto g was released i realized the specifications are perfect for me also it is very important to judge overall stability of the product rather than just specifications if high spec hardware is not tuned properly then desired usage experience can not be achieved considering previous moto g model performances i decided to buy this even if similar or better specs are available in the market at lower pric
- ize build inch screen is perfect for me and there are not many options available in the market the phone is handy with good build qualit
- ack cover finishing is nice and gives gri
- hough the back lid is not fitted with finesse and also plastic film in the top speaker lacks fine finishing but acceptable for this price rang
- esolution i am happy with p having full hd just for sake of it at the cost of battery does not make sense display is clear and vibrant no complaints touch performance is smooth does not miss any touche
- erformance did not have any lags in any activit
- owever i am yet to put pressure on phone gb ram supports the phone adequately somebody is comparing this phone with moto e just based on processor and it is hilariou
- attery i charged it full yesterday used it for hrs nonstop woke up today morning and used it moderately for hours and it is showing good battery performanc
- amera it is better than previous moto g version
- t is better than many peers in the market but it is not something which will blow your min
- ront camera is decent to
- udio call quality is good music sound quality in speakers is loud enough and clea
- ccessories charger comes with dual usb ports but takes some time to charge headphone ar
- ext level of perfection to moto generatio
- was initially thinking to buy other phone but when i heard about upcoming moto g release waited for launch and i am so much happy that it really worth waiting this phon
- he phone is just awesom
- amera both front and back are really good in taking picture
- ound quality is super
- o boltware apps simple smoot u
- ore than gb of ram available so no lags even while multitasking and gamin
- ood design and grip for holding phone in your hands superb call qualit

+ ound the speaker is not loud as i would expect sure to miss calls in bit noisy places sound quality even with headphones is average not bad as well is not goo

+ y experience with this aweosme phoneknot
+ have given stars in my review because i liked the phone and it meets my expectations this doesnt mean this phone is perfect it has its flaws but i havent found any major flaws i will give the detail of the flaws also in my revie
+ he delivery from flipkart also ws retail was really good it was packed well the delivery guy also prompted to open the box and check for the ite
+ bought the mobile in the first flash sale and have read most reviews on this phone here in flipkart it has been more than days since i have been using i
+ ow coming to the phone specifications it is certainly a killer note for the k price range it is one of the best phones i have see
+ t is lightweight and easy to hold the design is awesome and looks really good the phone comes with a removable battery which is what i wanted hence it made of body connected to phone and a plastic cover the plastic cover looks weak and sometimes there is a little problem of shaking but once it gets practiced both these dont look like problem screen doesnt come with gorilla glass but i dont think it matters much other than giving confidence and yah i accidentally dropped the phone once from feet and nothing happened it had a back cover but still so build will be
+ he inch full hd display is really awesome the quality is just superb touch is also smooth no lag in the touch though display takes a lot of the battery there are some methods to reduce battery consumption so
+ his is the first smartphone i own but i have used many other smartphones for long durations like htc one m asus zenfone samsung galaxy grand micromax canvas hd the nokia mobiles which i used before had to be charged once in days but ill have to charge this daily yet the battery performance of this phone is not bad with medium usage wifi for about hours a little gamingasphalt jumping tiles it comes for a little more than a day there many good options to reduce battery consumptionultra power saver so mah battery is not that bad as many reviews portray so
+ his is one part that many complain but it depends on what u like even if u dont like there tons of launcher to download so no worry in this departmen
+ his is one of the parts which i feared before buying the phone antutu readings showed k which is really awesome after buying i checked the score many times and it came k everytime though this are a little different from normal usage the phones performance for apps and usage is also superb good response no lags out of the gb ram it shows about mb available without any apps and mb with usage fo upto apps together one thing that i have found that even though it shows less there is not much problem it releases ram from system memory if high usage is required for example when i had apps running in the background it showed mb free i opened asphalt and started playing it usually uses min of mb of ram so i guessed it would lag or show around mb free but when i checked it showed mb so totally awesome performance and hence it is a killer note it has not lagged for me till now even when using asphalt so
+ his is also one thing that many are complaining and i cannot blame them they expected really good quality with but this camera is not that good its not bad but not the best still good use for those who click photos for memory fun and not professionalism so
+ his is the worst thing about this phone the sar value is whereas standards is less than so it is quite high it will be a problem if you are on calls for about an hour better to use earphones in such cases otherwise it might not pose much problems and also better to keep mobile away from body while sleeping and not too close to the body so
+ he phone does heat up while using high end games but i havent experience it while continuous use of wifi and there are many awesome features present in this phone which makes the usage of this phone really goo
+ have heard the after sales service of lenovo is good so that will be a relief if something bad happens this is really a good phone and i recommend using this the only people i dont recommend is who require the usage of this phone for continuous and long calls daily totally the phone is last but not the least im sorry for a large review but i wanted to give my full experience about this phone will try to update the review or create a new one after using it for month

+ rusted revie
+ fter using this phone for about three days these are my views about i
+ mazing looks good clarity is great and you can adjust the tone according to your taste but the ambient light sensor doesnt work properly in low lit areas and show weird response might be a software glitch that may improve with update another thing i noticed after using phone a lot the touch response starts loosing sense in lower portion of screen might be its in my phone or software issu
+ ear speaker is loud and has enough clarity use better earphones and u will love the sound through atmos software in the phon
+ ts clear with good reception and clarity just the sound through ear piece is bit low to my likin
+ idnt face any headache or anything does heat at ear piece if u accept calls while its chargin
+ oth rear and front camera are good not the best takes good pictures even in low light but ur hand should be sturdy or u would get blurred images no image stabilization videos taken are good but no touch to focus sometimes create a mes
+ attery and charging battery lasts a full day if u are a moderate user with all settings at on heavy user can accept charging at evening hrs of screen on time is goo
+ hen storage is set to phone no apps can store data to sd card and when storage set to sd card sd card is ur primary memory and all data saved to sd card even whatsapp data phone storage remains intac
+ hats all its a best phone if ur budget is k decide as per ur needs and this revie
+ wsome phone with great performanc
+ his is the best phone under k price tag i like the look and feel of the phone which is way better than a k budget phone the phone is amazingly light weight which some people like and some dont the performance is the best part of this mobile its silky smooth whatever is thrown onto that processor it just does the job pretty smoothly the only thing i am little worried is its battery its mah which could be a little more than k mah the disappointing thing in the phone is that i expected a better camera the camera is just above averag
+ ther than camera everything is awesome in this phon
+ ome new features have been introduced in this model like wide touch we do not have to use the lock button the ui is designed very well and it looks fluidic the touch is also super smoot

+ fter two weeks of use heres sharing my experience
+ he phone is wonderful at first sight its really lightweight for a inch screen and mah battery yes not with a great display including the screen to body ratio colours are nice and vibrant in the box you would find the usb cable with adapater along with a free screen guard it does not have any gorilla glass protection and no headphones bad it takes a lot to remove the battery a real fight it is the hardware is heavily packed but the os and the bloatwares mostly from google itself takes away some shine around gb is available and these cannot be moved to sd card inspite of having lolipop lenovo still has not provided users with the latest version which allows the apps to be moved to sd card moreover inspite of a gb of ram only mb at max is available thankfully theres no lag even with high end games but need to clear it from the recent menu once you are out of the game rear is great with crisp and sharp pictures however th
  mp multifeatured front cam trumps in this category selfie kingsqueens would love it the phone does have some nice and useful features which many would find useful the power saver especially is brilliant as also some other smart feaures with heavy usage battery would hardly last a day but with low to medium usage battery would last more than a day specially with the above feature tunred on as and when required the phone heats up on medium outdoor usage and when you play high end games understandbly because its octa core at the point right below the camera guess thats where the cpu is the sound section is overall very bad speaker phone is decent but the ring tone cannot be heard even from the next room while speaking if you hold the phone at degrees or even far the person on the other side would barely be able to hear you as if you are speaking from the border the mm jack is the biggest trick of lenovo which does not allow other earphones to be jac
e in sounds like apple isnt it no accessories available yet not sure if the ones for a would fit even flipkart execs could not assist one big problem i have faced is with the proximity sensor not working properly long duration calls easily ensures a lot of background apps being initiated due to the sensor not working properly needs a big update to fix all these overall for the price ta

+ ets start with the pros of k not
+ isplay the display is crisp and vivid its accurate and the colour reproduction is accurate the viewing angles are good but not great you will not find a reason to complain and there is a option to boost display brightness in sunlight under settings it needs to be tested as i have not seen the sun due to rains in past days of getting devic
+ uild is good and the soft touch back is nice to hold its same build and look of a a and i do not see the reason to complain the vol and power buttons are metal and thats goo
+ ensors which are needed are present you have double tap to wake and gesture controls there is no tap to sleep i admire the fact that lenovo has given proper sensors and led notification light it has gyro accelerometer magnetometer orientation sensor gravity sensor light and proximity sensor and all of them work wel
+ px front facing camera is good it has beauty shot and mpx rear camera is decent it can be compared to m note and one camera and i assure you lenovo k camera is than meizu m note and on par with oneplus camer
+ oth sims support g which is good thing and the network strength and call quality is good i can say that voice quality over the earpiece is better than oneplus one the rear speaker is good too better than mii and has good depth of voice there is no distortion of sound loudness is lower than oneplus and a plus but better than m note from meizu and mi 
+ ifi and tethering have good range in my house the last room gets very low signal strength but k note was showing or bars where other mobile like oneplus either drop wifi or show just a dot speed over cellular network is very goo
+ pu is mali t mp which will let you play any game in playstore without a issue but the thing here is the same gpu performs better in a as it has less pixels to push on screen i have noticed some lag and drops in frame in some heavy games like asphalt nova while they play better on 
+ ouch is good and i would say better than a which i was using earlier and i would say touch response is better than one
