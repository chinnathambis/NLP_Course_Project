-Now coming to CONS
-the device is very good but not the perfect device as it could have been.
-the look is similar to A7000 and the design is now old, all the A6000, A6000+, A7000 and K3 note are same design.
-also the back on K3 note is less rigid than one on A6000+
-SAR ratings are the highest on any device seen in recent times, its almost at the allowed limit.
-allowed limit in India is 1.6 w/kg and K3 note has 1.59 w/kg. very high.
-dont get this device if you talk a lot on your cell phone.
-i am quite suprised that no one talks about this
-there is no protection on glass like corning or dragontrail, the glass is hardned glass as per what customer support told me but its a finger print magnet and it does get scratched quite easily as i have seen on A7000. get a tempered glass of good quality
-The dolby atmos does not work with every music, i dont see any change in music when dolby is on or off.
-also the quality through headphones is not good. i tried it with different headphones.
-Vibe UI is not that good, it feels like a half baked version of android with missing features.
-for instance there is no option to edit lock screen or the notification lights depending on your choice. nothing 3rd party launcher or lightflow wont fix
-Battery and heating.
-well i would say 2 days is not enough but using both sims and wifi always on, i am seeing battery life is not that great.
-its decent but i would say that i am getting much higher battery life on my oneplus and when playing games, it does heat up a bit. dont get me wrong its not very hot but it does heat up to around 44 - 47C. the biggest issue for me is the screen heats up too and using device for call is hard then. dont expect it to run cool but it will not heat up a lot.
-RAM optimization needs rework, on first boot you will get around 950 mb but i have seen fore close of apps when multi tasking.
-its a issue with software and not hardware.
-Final say,
-i would say if your usage is more towards multimedia consumption and using device to chat of social sites along with some casual gaming then at this price, you have no other option. there will be some heating but it beats all other devices in under 12K bracket. if you use this as primary device and take lot of calls, be safe and get something else as it has very high SAR value which you should take note of.
-Lenovo voids warranty when you root or install custom OS
-Lenovo K3 Note Camera
-Not good quality of rear and front
-and
-5mp front qualitty is like 2 mp
-not satisfacted
-if u are a heavy game lover then my humble request is not to buy this mobile.just received mobile yesterday and switched on it and i installed asphalt 8, what i noticed is it is lagging which will not let u enjoy the game at all and iam very much disappointed with this. even clash of clan is also lagging. it is only recommended for those who wont play much games and use for calling(max)
-pros:good battery
-large internal memory
-large screen
-cons:bad bad camera,
-it clearly lags,u will definitely hate this,
-heating problem
-Killer Note, Yes, its ready to kill you.
-Its a piece of crap, Heats like an iron box over the ear, and wifi stops working in the middle,
-For heating issue the answer they have is "battery is still less than 45Deg so normal sir"
-Flipkart Idiots, I am taking using earpiece, not with battery. And I ordered a phone ,not an Iron box.
-Wifi issue, Its a common issue, the wifi chip is not stable, so you have to adjust with it.
-Its worth buying with little risk
-I was using Mi 3 which I bought on first batch sale, It is one of the most beautiful and awesome proforming mobile.
-This time on first sale I bought LENOVO K3 note, It didnt disappoint me in terms of value for money.
-Good things.
-Nice Built quality.
-Superb music quality.
-Very handy to use even with 5.5 inch screen.
-Awasome UI
-Not Good things.
-Battery back up is very bad.
-Its getting heat while watching youtube videos and front camera.
-In last one week usage it got hanged once, I am scared.
-ime will Tell - which is the best phone of them all
-The price.
-Did I mention the price?
-The back camera is among the best in a phone in this price range.
-A decent number of options, a good stabilization mechanism (albeit manual).
-The HDR option doesn't instantly make your photos better like the one on the Nexus 5, but it does a good enough job of highlighting contrasts and brightening what needs to be brightened. Although it leaves lots to be desired when compared to, say, the camera on the Oneplus One. That thing's a beast! I may be biased here, because I just love the Oneplus One cameras - both front and back.
-It's light and looks way better in reality than it does in the pictures. Black and sleek.
-The back cover is a little plastic-y, but it's matte and looks good.
-Huge battery. 50% has lasted me 5 hours now, being used as much as a normal phone would be.
-With wifi on and everything.
-It's on charge now.
-It's got expandable storage.
-It's one of the few new phones which has a removable battery.
-No excessive heating issues or system / app crashes so far.
-The price. Come on, it costs 10k.
-Does not suport automatic sms internet settings - found out to my dismay from the Vodafone IVR system.
-Excessive amounts of bloatware including 4 games, the Flipkart app (cheap move there, Flipkart), a navigation app whose name I've forgotten since deleting it and a pretty useless note-taking application that, for some reason, refuses to work without you logging into it.
-You will have about 700MB of usable RAM, once you clear out all background processes - the majority of it seems to be getting eaten up by the un-friendly interface.
-The quick-access drag-down settings are cramped together worse than you would be on a Mumbai local, with many tiny icons that are squashed together.
-I have no shortage of complaints about the cluttered, RAM-hungry UI that Lenovo has used in the K3 Note.
-It just serves to make the phone slower, and with just 2GB RAM, that's no something they could afford to do.
-The call screen also seems really cluttered with buttons everywhere. Useful in a way, but aesthetically unappealing - if you give stock by such a thing.
-The front camera is pathetic, 5 megapixels maybe, but slow, blurry and unable to capture a decent still image even with the slightest of movement. No sharpness to speak of, and I'm sure my face isn't all that blurry.
-The phone isn't the fastest thing available, nor the sturdiest, but considering the price and bang-for-buck value - it's among the best out there. It uses quality components that will last, but I think has skimped on the RAM. Could've used another 1GB for the kind of apps that are being released lately, and the kind of multitasking that's being demanded off of phones today. If you're on a budget and are deciding between phones of the same congifuration, however, buy this one. You will not be disappointed till you save enough to invest in one of the bigger, faster phones with more processing power.
-I'm not too certain the phone is as industry-smashing, flagship-killing and other-brand-beating as its 10k pricetag, though.
-Only time will tell.
-I am very much satisfied with phone, but from the minute I received (09-10-2015),
-I am not using much except phone calls for maximum 45 mins in a day, but battery lasts for only maximum of 14 hrs and today
-I recharged 100% for 2 times.
-I am unable to use data connection from 2nd sim. Don't know why.
-Its heating while charging and in call.
-Is anybody facing these issues?
-Kindly let me know, if I am the one, I will proceed further.
-Hi Friends,
-This is a overall product it have some demerits like:
-Back cover is very poor quality.
-very poor quality rear camera as compared to other phone camera as per 13 mp.
-resolution is not good whenever zoom a picture.
-this phone is very weight less not like 150 g.
-Not given earphone with this product this is big issue also.
-The SAR value is very high as per the govt of India permitted,not good for health.
-Screen quality is also very poor.
-Sound is very slow when set below 70% volume control.
-flipkart can't fulfil delivery comttment as per given time.
-flipkart shows 3000mah battery in specification page but actually it is 2900mah.
-so finally friends don't buy this phone as per price.
-Average 4G Mobile. Redmi 4G Note is better with average rating of 4.1
-After waiting for 2 years I brought K3 looking at the brand during the first sale and felt lucky to grab it but after almost 1 month to certain extent I am disappointed. I would rate it at 3. Wished I would have bought Redmi 4G Note instead with 2K less and additional 1K with exchange.
-Light weight.
-Wide viewing angle and good screen clarity.
-Rear Camera is awesome in light but decreases clarity in low light. LED Flash is good.
-Dolby Atmos is good provided you have high end Headset like Skull Candy for which you would need to spend another 500 Rs +.
-Connectivity is good but depends on your network provider.
-Phone heats up even after playing Candy Crush for 15 mins.
-Front camera though a 5MP is pathetic. My Nokia E5 at 5MP is excellent.
-Sometime after unlocking the phone the full screen is black with only icons visible. No trace of Theme and wallpaper.
-No headset.
-Comes with useless Apps which cant be uninstalled sometimes and use the RAM.
-Only ~850MB is available of the 2GB RAM.
-Screen guard is pathetic. When I complained to flipkart they added 200 Rs in my wallet only to know that I cant use that as WS Retail does not sell accessories.
-Compare Redmi 4G Note with K3 and then decide which one is good.
-Very bad experience with Flipkart and Lenevo K3 note.
-Lenevo`s UI & OS takes up a lot of RAM, upto 1 GB at all times.
-Phone is slow and takes random reboots.
-Wifi is not working since day 1, since 296 MB update.
-Reported this issue to Flipkart and asked for a return, and they arranged for a call with one of their "expert" and she told me that phone is working fine and wifi is also working while this phone won`t detect any wifi network and can`t use the phone as a wifi hot-spot. Flipkart asked me to take this phone to service center and did not provide a replacement.
-Touch screen is OK.
-battery backup is not that good, more is expected from 2900 MaH battery.
-Flipkart delivery took 7 days and multiple followups to deliver the phone.
-Best Full HD budget mobile
-Good Display
-Camera is very good in day light
-No Over Heating (Max Temperature i found was 42 degrees after playing Asplalt 8)
-Good UI (better than waht i expected)
-GOOD SOUND
-Camera is not so good in Low Light
-Slow charging (it takes 2 hours of time to charge completely when running apps are closed)
-Asphalt 8 lags in High Graphics mode
-NO PROTECTIVE SCREEN
-good phone with some manageable quirks
-i have both a7000 and k3 ...what i notice is that screen color is more towards the colder side in k3 i.e white will look more like bluish white in this.( i would have preferred more neutral tone but screen clarity and viewing angle is awesome)
-charging time is a big problem. (battery 2900)
-speaker sound is shit in both the phone...u will find problem to hear the voice through the phone earpiece if u are at some busy place.(call quality is less on our side)
-ram available is less in k3 compared to a7000.(though this never affected the performance)
-network signal strength in a7000 and k3 is comparatively less than the other phones it fluctuates a lot which never happened with my moto g or samsung basic phone.(but again till now i dont have face any problem of no network but consider this fact also that i live in central mumbai )
-so just take this things into consideration.....no doubt this is a good phone for the price we are paying but it can be better if they would have included fast charging and better earpiece
-Chat applications NOT working
-Thought it would b great. But it dissapointed!!!
-Chat applications (Messenger, WhatsApp, WeChat, etc) are not working!!! Could not initialise WhatsApp... If I send a message through Messenger intended person is not getting that message!!! What the HELL!!!!!!!!
-Contacted with Vodafone customer care but they are saying services are not blocked, so may be an issue of WhatsApp and Messenger. Then contacted with WhatsApp they are saying to ask Vodafone for internet settings.
-Has anybody faced this issue earlier???
-BUDGET
-Few POINTS noted after using this phone which is not there in product description:
-LENOVO K50a40 is INDIAN version of K3 note
-Camera quality is good as per budget but if we compare to Samsung Galaxy S4/S5 or MI 4I, then it lacks in various terms
-No Headphones or Back cover
-Screen guard is not upto the mark
-Battery is 2900 MaH, but it drains immediately after few hours usage. Need to charge twice a day
-User interface is good, text and images are crisp & clear
-Dolby Atmos is an app like you download other apps from store just to improve music quality
-Go for it if you don't wants to spend more money on other PHABETS
-Product returned, waiting to book a replacement...
-This is my first mobile of Moto (I own an HTC 516 and my brother has a Moto E, and he has faced no problem with that till now. *Touchwood*). My first experience was good. The initial set up took some time but the function was smooth and not sluggish. Obviously I bought this for the features and my first check was the camera.
-Both the front and rear camera quality is great. I took a few snaps with the front camera with dimmed lighting and it came out nice. Overall think the phone stands up to whatever is said about it.
-Don't wanna repeat the specs and give a boring comment on that. But think in this price range Moto has really given a good phone with good features.
-And it seems all what I said is bouncing back on me and hitting me hard.
-The video playback is sluggish and when I contacted the Moto help thru their online facility, the person said that it will be recurring and I need to follow a list of steps to clear cache on the phone.
-Now if the problem is recurring, they why can't they service the mobile? Or give a replacement?
-Visited the Moto Service center.
-They said software needs to be updated.
-Put up my case to Flipkart and they have taken my mobile back and given a refund.
-Good Product from Motorola
-Performance
-Storage
-Water resistant
-Unremovable battery
-Battery- Samsung(3000mah)
-Water resistant- Moto G3(plus point)
-Now talking about specs, while both are almost identical, Moto G3 handles games better with no lag and heating because of its UI(heats up a little when on charge), while touchwiz uses up a lot of RAM which leaves about 500-800 Ram for other apps..it can only hold 4 apps while Moto G3 can hold 18 apps with ease!
-Now Now there are small things like slight price difference,dual flash,front facing flash,4G LTE but thats up to you..
-In conclusion i'll give Moto G3 8.5 and Samsung J5 an 8.
-If you want better resolutions,selfies and more battery life, go for the J5.
-these phones are simply the best in range right now
-Motorolla really learned how to make a good phone
-I bought moto g 1st gen on first day of its release (Feb6th 2013) and moto g3 also i bought on first day itself.
-Motorola delivers on fronts which really matters. No bells and whistles, pure performance. If you want a iPhone like phone in android at low cost moto is the go to phone.
-Moto G3 Usability
-My review is completely based on usability.
-Multitasking is very fluent with all basic social networking running backend.
-Screen clarity is good with 300 ppi approx. for a 5 inch mobile..
-Stock android L experience is great.
-Both front and rear camera captures good snaps. Specially brightness/saturation is added appropriately to the pics taken from selfie cam.
-Call clarity at both end is very good.
-Water resistance is added advantage.
-Built quality is very sturdy . Feels mobile is much secured and good while holding it in hands due to its back grip cover.
-Graphics and quadCore performance is nice, I have played Asphalt 8 and mortal kombat and it runs fluently.
-Battery backup is very good, it almost gives a whole day backup with wifi/3G on and normal usage.
-Mobile stays little warm all the time compared to other mobile. I am not sure if this isuue is common or specific to my mobile. Waiting for other reviews
-Great phone
-After a long gap I have purchased motorola phone. For 3 years i have been using samsung phones. And to be frank samsung phones suck. They are slow, hang up and heat up despite claiming good specs. I had grand 2 before motorola g3 and from day one I had heating issues, poor battery back up and despite 1.5 gb ram, grand 2 was slow.
-But when i compare the new motorola phone, oh boy, it is fast and responsive.
-Touch is very responsive and fast
-Absolutely no lag (13 apps loaded so far). Samsung Grand 2 used to hang up.
-No heating issues. (Samsung grand 2 used to get heated up like an oven)
-Battery seems to last for good 10 hours with mobile data or wifi on
-Phone feels light in hand/pocket and the ergonomics is great.
-The back panel looks premium and gives a nice grip in hand
-4g connectivity is great
-Call sound quality is crisp and clear
-Camera is super fast (samsung camera is like a snail)
-Water resistant feature is great though i haven't yet tested.
-Jet black screen oozes beauty
-Non-removable battery
-I found UI of samsung more friendly but this is not really a con and may be i am not used to motorola UI
-Good and Awesome
-I got the product with in less than 12hrs.
-I like the Design and Camera.
-Its pure Android OS, Such a smooth and Fast OS.
-Frame is Fiber but not metal.
-Except all good.
-Thank you Flipkart and MOTO.
-My next review after one month of usage of this product.
-Good Upgrade from G2
-First of all, super fast delivery! I ordered the phone at around 1130am and was unboxing it by 4pm on the same day!
-Secondly, I exchanged my old Moto G1 for this Phone, so got a great discount too.
-It is a great phone for it's price range and that is what made me hang on to my Moto G1 until now, when I found I the right upgrade.
-As of now, I got a chance to test the camera and the pictures have come out great both in low light and during the day.
-The flash upgrade has helped.
-The phone is fast and apps do not have any lag.
-I used to face a lag for certain large games on he G1 but don't seem to face any of that on this phone yet.
-Would recommend this phone to anyone any day.
-My only concern is that flipkart could have taken the old phone after a day (as they charge you for pickup anyway) as it would have given a chance to try out moto migrate between the two phones.
-certified buyer
-Buy it for a smooth experience, not for flaunting specs
-I have updated my experience after 5 days of usage at the bottom.
-I have been using an Xperia (high end) and shifted to Moto G3.
-I am a moderate intensity user with majority usage in communication apps. No major gaming usage. As soon as Moto G3 was released, I realized the specifications are perfect for me. Also, it is very important to judge overall stability of the product rather than just specifications. If high spec hardware is not tuned properly, then desired usage experience can not be achieved. Considering previous Moto G model performances, I decided to buy this, even if similar or better specs are available in the market at lower price.
-Size, Build 5 inch screen is perfect for me and there are not many options available in the market. The phone is handy, with good build quality.
-Back cover finishing is nice and gives grip.
-Though the back lid is not fitted with finesse and also, plastic film in the top speaker lacks fine finishing. But acceptable for this price range.
-Resolution I am happy with 720p. Having full HD just for sake of it at the cost of battery does not make sense. Display is clear and vibrant. No complaints. Touch performance is smooth, does not miss any touches.
-Performance Did not have any lags in any activity.
-However I am yet to put pressure on phone. 2 GB RAM supports the phone adequately. Somebody is comparing this phone with Moto E just based on processor, and it is hilarious.
-Battery I charged it full yesterday, used it for 1:30 hrs non-stop. Woke up today morning and used it moderately for 6 hours and it is showing 52%. Good battery performance.
-Camera It is better than previous Moto G versions.
-It is better than many peers in the market. But it is not something which will blow your mind.
-Front camera is decent too.
-Audio Call quality is good. Music sound quality in speakers is loud enough and clear.
-Accessories Charger comes with dual USB ports. But takes some time to charge. Headphone are
-Next level of perfection to Moto Generation.
-I was initially thinking to buy other phone, but when i heard about upcoming Moto G3 release, waited for launch and i am so much happy that it really worth waiting this phone.
-The phone is just awesome:-
-Camera both front and back are really good in taking pictures.
-Sound Quality is superb.
-No boltware apps, simple smoot UI.
-More than 1 GB of Ram available, so no lags even while multitasking and gaming.
-Good design and grip for holding phone in your hands, superb call quality.
-Both sim supports 4G.
-No cons till now and thanks flipkart for faster and well packed delivery.
-Just suggest everyone to go for this phone, as it is next level of perfection to moto generation.
+Review after using k3 note for 38 days got on first sale.
+Review after using k3 note for 38 days.
+I boughtt k3 note in 1st flash sale (8th july) and delivered on 11th july. My Antutu performance is 43653, which is very good.
+First thing is Software update - Please update it with 17 MB, don't go for 296 MB update otherwise you may face some Heating or wifi or Battery backup issue. I have the 17 mb update in my system and facing no problem at all many are reporting to have problem. So its better wait for few days.
+Display hd crisp display, pixel control is awesome, Viewing angle very good. you are getting a dual core graphics processor which is powered by mali-T760MP2 i.e. the latest battery efficient, powerful graphics card ever even from adreno..
+Processorlenovo has given true octa core means all the cores have been clocked to 1.7 ghz which is rare in other brands. All other octacore mobiles doesn't give the core by same clock-work power.
+Gaming You can play Heavy games like Asphalt 8 without any lag.
+UI Inbuilt VIVE UI is good but not the best one. Better wait for vibe's latest version, will be released this month.
+Dolby ATMOS if you have a JBL, SONY, Beats, PHILLPS etc (reputed company headphones) you are going to blast with the dolby atmos feature. Ram - 2 GB ram with a DDR3 quality means it can give the boost of a 2.5gb at max work-load, which is again an extra benefit from lenovo. out of 2 GB you will get around 900 MB free.
+ROM 16 GB internal with a free space of 11+ GB enough to load heavy games and data..
+LTE both the sim-slot support 4G lte
+SAR rating It has SAR rating of 1.59W/kg which is same as
+Camera Primary cam is good enough and the SLR option is an advantage. As a smartphone photographer the device is very good but in low light a bit crappy but adjustable. Front cam is good for selfies but the beauty option soften the pics Focal length is 3.54 mm.
+Battery 900 mAh Good enough to stand 1 full day with 1 hr gaming (like Asphalt 8), 1 hr video, full day wifi, mobile data, 30 min call, 4 hrs music
+No such major problems observed yet
+UI preinstalled apps are little awkward but you can easily unistall it.
+Themes Should provide more options to download themes.
+Heating a mobile with this much specs can heat a liitle. its not a issue becoz i know the facts
+Overall its value for money product, FULLY PAISA VASOOL
+Hi I bought this product on 8th July which was the 1st flash sale.
+The phone seems to be fine and so are the features, only concern being the high SAR value. Also the Product was delivered on time.
+The phone worked fine for the first 12 days. But then I noticed that the battery would drain within a few hours of charging and post that the battery just gave up.
+Tried using another battery to switch the phone on and the phone works just fine.
+I am surprised that Lenovo is providing such poor quality products and flipkart backing them up.
+I will now have to either return the product to flipkart or search a Lenovo service station hoping for them to replace the battery.
+This mostly will be my last purchase from flipkart and lenovo
+Will update post my interaction with Lenovo service station.
+Best phone in range of 9999 and awesome features .
+Pros: Full HD Screen
+Camera 13 MP with great Quality
+Faster than any other phone
+Long Battery life
+And much more
+Best phone to buy today don't miss next sell
+Problem with lenovo k3
+heat and draining the battery and you can feel heat while talking to phone, you can feel this in 2 min. After starting the call. I can say this is bad design because charging port is at top of the phone near to ear piece. This should be at mic
+Best Brand and Specs phone at this price
+Pros
+Fantastic upgrade in terms of brand, configuration and best value for money.
+Camera quality is amazing.
+Cons:
+Don't see any Cons after buying this phone.
+Heating Tooo Badly
+I purchased from flipkart got the product on 13 july only swipe on the cause excessively heating after checking scree temperature about 48oC . i placed return request their assistant told me submit this mobile to service centre. we are not responsible any kind of heating issue in the product . So don'T purchase this product.
+go for it guys..........
+i checked this phone there is no problem
+like
+heating
+processing
+multi taking or else
+support best video quality
+go for it dont miss the offer
+thanks for flipkart for one day delivery
+thanks to airtel for 4g free 4g sim....
+specs are good but Having issues really worried about having future complaints
+I ordered it on 9/7/2015 and flipkart delivered it to me on 13/07/2015. 13 Mp rear camera is good but 5 Mp front camera is average. Display is good. Battery back is not great as i charged it and used 1 hour for seeing the performance it went down to 70%. Heating issues while using internet and playing games within 30 minutes. Really worried about phone getting complaints in the future. So I am using it very cautiously. Usually I heard good responses for lenovo phones so i purchased my first Lenovo Phone but my expedition regarding the product was not very much pleasing after using it.
+Awesome phone to own if you plan to by 5.5 inch
+I bought this phone on 1st flash sale and following are my observartions using it for 1 days.
+PROS
+1. Light weight.All the persons who checked my mobile was surprised of light weight it was.Good weight distibution
+Audio quality-Very crisp and clear with dolby audio(Tested with sennheiser CX 275 s).
+Display: Full HD and it was Awesome experince.Tried watching HD video and it was like wow. Similar to Sony Bravia display phones .
+Body: Good build quality for below 10000 phones.Very slim and handy
+Connectivity: tried bluetooth,wifi and 4g.Everything is awesome and works as expected
+Games: Plays all high end games smoothly .
+Camera: Front camera is awesome for selfies.Back camera is very nice compared to other sub 10k phones.
+Storage: 16gb is ample.Really good for installing apps
+Black color phone is really good looking .Nice premium looks.
+Myself Installed Lolipop launcher and now you will not miss app launcher.
+Amps charger and it looks sturdy and good in the price segment.
+Need improvement for camera on low lit areas and indoor
+Minimum 1 GB Ram is always occupied for OS and preinstalled Apps.
+Battery backup is ok .keeps it for 1 day after using 3.5 hours of wifi and internet.If i continuously use for 6 hours of wifi and 3g, it will be finished.
+But all PROS shadows the cons.Go for it blindly.
+COMPARISON with Honor 4x
+Advantages for Lenovo K3
+Premium looks
+Sound quality
+Full Hd display
+Disadvantages:
+Camera.
+WLAN GIVING AUTHENTICATION PROBLEM
+Well I was pretty excited for my phone and it worked out to be nice...
+sound
+display
+weight are good....
+CONS
+gaming
+camera
+and a lot of pre-loaded apps make it worse.
+Then out of 2GB ram it always shows ~700mb....and
+then Since today tenth day of usage it stopped connecting with the WIFI...i checked it with 3 different routers and i have authentication issues.Well I've filed a return and let see what assistance will flipkart assign me
+Lenovo K3 Note...
+Hii guys, thanks for such a nice phone launched by Lenovo company.
+The delivery service was very bad by the delivery man, delivered the package on committed time, but without contacting or informing the about the delivery time.
+Secondly the Lenovo K3 Note phone is overall good, no issues and smooth functioning software's and applications.
+Now the real issue is, the device is getting over heat even if you do not browse the internet or else you if you don't play a game also. Just browsing the phone menu makes the phone over heat, which is something needs to be sort out the by the Lenovo Technical engineers to resolve the heating issue.
+Thirdly the battery power drains very fast, after charged to a 100% full and even after using the function of battery saver power.
+I charged the phone 100% full in evening, guess what after an hour, the battery power drop to 88% without making any calls, browsing the internet, playing games and even on standby mode also.
+I really don't understand, the company promises of long battery life atleast for 1 full day and which is something worst.
+You can also not use the external sd card applications at the same time owhen using internal memory, if you acces anyone of the memory, you'll not be able to use some of the applications such as google play store with proper wifi and internet connection.
+Lastly, when I unboxed the phone the screenguard which came with the handset was of low quality and was not sticking to the screen.
+Please make sure the readers, who are planning to buy this Lenovo K3 Note phone think thrice and then only buy the phone.
+Got a defective phone
+Facing following issues with the new K3 note phone bought from Flipkart:
+There is some problem with the microphone as during the call the other person is not able to hear anything, so it is not doing the most basic function what a phone is supposed to do. Don't know how can Lenovo ship such products to customers without testing properly.
+Phone is getting heat up within few minutes of using.
+Battery of the phone is so tight that it takes lot of effort to take out. You cannot take it out using your fingers or nails and have to use some other sharp object and lot of time and effort to pull out.
+have immediately put a return request to Flipkart for replacing the device but their process is taking too much time and I expect it is still going to take lot of time.Really frustrated with the overall experience.
+People who are considering to buy K3 note, I would advise to consider some other phone if you do not want to go through any hassles as mentioned above.
+Worst Mobile & Worst Service from Flipkart
+I have purchase first time mobile from flipkart.
+Performance of Lenovo K3 note is very bad.

+Battery getting low without use of mobile.
+Mobile switch of automatically.
+Really an Awesome Phone!!!!!
+After one week of using Lenovo K3.
+First thing first!!!!

+Nice features. It equals a 30k worth mobile.
+Valuable & worth for the money!!!!!

+Good internet speed.
+Call clarity good.
+Double tap to wake feature.
+Access camera when device is locked using the volume keys and take pictures.
+GPS accuracy lags.
+System itself occupies 1GB of RAM.
+Sometime disabling internet from the lock screen doesn't work even though the icon shows as disabled.
+Doesn't supports dual band 802.11 b/g/n/ac. 5Ghz is not working in wifi.

+Rest...Its a good Phone.... Value for MOney!!!
+Go for it!!!!
+Any phone will be in rectangle shape of course few phones are available in Square shape as well. Cause our pockets are Rectangle/Square shape :P
+So Design of phone wont be a concern. By the way Size and Weight of the phone is OK (5.5 Inch & 150 Grams)
+Battery
+Removable 3000 mAh battery (Its a Power Beast Battery which lasts at least 24hrs ON Full with Wi-Fi/3G/4G)
+Performance
+Its a 2GB RAM @1.7 GHz + Cortex-A53--- this processor runs fast @ smooth performance.
+Graphics chip is ARM Mali-T760 which is latest technology and its mainly used for the Games & watching Animation Videos of Superb quality.
+Special Feature: 5/5
+Its a Full HD (1920 x 1080 Pixels) IPS display phone. Screen Viewing at this resolution will be AWESOME.
+Sound Enhancement - Dolby Atmos - To enjoy this feature One should have a Branded Headphones so that every bit of music will be enjoyed with this "Dolby Atmos" feature.
+Camera
+13MP primary and 5 MP Rear(Front) Cam.
+I heard a lot many NEGATIVE reviews about the CAM for most the mobiles. It's not the fault of the Mobile CAM it's a problem with the MOBILE Owners, they take a snap and expect the Quality should be of DSLR :P.
+If you want a Descent Pic then go for "HDR" mode, here the condition is "Both the Object and CAM should be Steady" then you will get a AWESOME Pic :D
+If you want to cover a Long area then go for "Panorama" Mode. here the condition is "Both the Object and CAM should be in LINE" then you will get a Long Awesome Pic :D
+Overall
+What else your looking @9999 price range.
+This is the BEST phone from all perspectives ust GO
+Even if you don't like the above spec then
+words guyz i reqst u to buy this phone

+Best phone to buy today don't miss next sell
+Worthy product for 10K but nor a Killer Note
+I own Galaxy Note3 N900. I was waiting for OnePlus 2. But could not resist my urge to try out the well hyped 'Killer Note' for 10K.
+I am going to compare it with Note 3(current cost Rs 30K, cost when I bought Rs 45K!)
+Display: I didn't expect the display to be good. But, it is vivid and pleasure to use though the contrast can never be compared with AMOLED display. This is the best part of K3 Note.
+Camera: OK camera. Bit laggy and lot of over processing done . For selfies it seems to be better than Galaxy Note 3
+Performance: No issues and lags in regular use. But, you can see the occasional frame drops when there is lot of IO(like update or install of apps in the BG). I see this in a Galaxy Note 3 as well. But never try to use features like Secure zone and expect it to perform. It lags like hell when you enable secure zone. 2GB RAM is not enough for this feature.
+The main reason I wanted to get this phone. Hell with Sammy for not giving LTE in Note 3. 4G speed I saw with Airtel was 11Mbps download - must faster than 3Mbps I used to get in 3G
+Battery: I got only 2900mah battery(minimum spec). Not sure who gets the 3000mah battery. If most of the pieces shiped with 2900 better to update teh spec with 2900mah instead of 3000mah. It is too early to comment on the battery. But my initial use shows similar battery performance as Note 3. Yet to load all my apps.
+Software: Better than Touchwiz. But there are bloat-wares in this as well. But, there will be stable CM for K3 Note in couple of months. Note 3, yet to get a stable CM and Note 5 is expected in couple of months.
+Sound: The speaker is not loud as I would expect. Sure to miss calls in bit noisy places. Sound quality even with headphones is average. Not bad as well is not good.
+Sensors: Has all important sensors. Additional FM is good compared to Note3. But I may miss IR blaster. Wont miss: NFC, Gesture,Humidity,Pressure & Temperature sensors of Note 3.
+Build:OK build quality & feel. Almost same size as Note 3 but bit lighter.
+ottom-line:
+Is it a good purchase for someone looking for a phablet: Definitely Yes.
+Will it replace my Note 3: No. I will wait for OnePlus 2
+My experience with this aweosme phone(K3Note)
+I have given 5 stars in my review because I liked the phone and it meets my expectations. This doesn’t mean this phone is perfect. It has its flaws but I haven’t found any major flaws. I will give the detail of the flaws also in my review.
+The delivery from flipkart (also WS retail) was really good. It was packed well. The delivery guy also prompted to open the box and check for the item.
+I bought the mobile in the first flash sale, and have read most reviews on this phone here in flipkart. It has been more than 15 days since I have been using it.
+Now coming to the phone specifications, it is certainly a killer note. For the 10k price range it is one of the best phones I have seen.
+It is lightweight and easy to hold. The design is awesome and looks really good. The phone comes with a removable battery (Which is what I wanted). Hence it made of body connected to phone and a plastic cover. The plastic cover looks weak and sometimes there is a little problem of shaking. But once it gets practiced, both these don’t look like problem. Screen doesn’t come with gorilla glass but I don’t think it matters much other than giving confidence. And yah I accidentally dropped the phone once from 3 feet and nothing happened. It had a back cover, but still. So build will be 8/10.
+The 5.5 inch Full HD display is really awesome. The quality is just superb. Touch is also smooth. No lag in the touch. Though display takes a lot of the battery there are some methods to reduce battery consumption. So 10/10
+This is the first smartphone I own ( But I have used many other smartphones for long durations like HTC One M8, Asus Zenfone 5, Samsung Galaxy Grand, Micromax Canvas HD). The nokia mobiles which I used before had to be charged once in 2-5 days, but I’ll have to charge this daily. Yet, the battery performance of this phone is not bad. With medium usage( Wifi for about 10 hours, a little gaming(asphalt, jumping tiles) ) it comes for a little more than a day. There many good options to reduce battery consumption(Ultra power saver) so 2900mAH battery is not that bad as many reviews portray. So 8/10
+This is one part that many complain. But it depends on what u like. Even if u don’t like, there tons of launcher to download. So no worry in this department.
+This is one of the parts which I feared before buying the phone. Antutu readings showed 45k+ which is really awesome. After buying I checked the score many times and it came 45k+ everytime. Though this are a little different from normal usage, the phone’s performance for apps and usage is also superb. Good response, no lags. Out of the 2GB ram, it shows about 700-1000mb available without any apps and 400-600mb with usage fo upto 11 apps together. One thing that I have found that even though it shows less, there is not much problem. It releases ram from system memory if high usage Is required.( for example when I had 4 apps running in the background it showed 520mb free. I opened asphalt and started playing. It usually uses min of 300-500mb of ram so I guessed it would lag or show around 0-200 mb free. But when I checked it showed 450mb.) So totally awesome performance and hence it is a killer note. It has not lagged for me till now even when using asphalt8. So 10/10.
+This is also one thing that many are complaining and I cannot blame them. They expected really good quality with 13/5, but this camera is not that good. It’s not bad, but not the best. Still good use for those who click photos for memory, fun and not professionalism. So 8/10
+This is the worst thing about this phone. The SAR value is 1.590 whereas standards Is less than 1.6. SO it is quite high. It will be a problem if you are on calls for about an hour. Better to use earphones in such cases. Otherwise it might not pose much problems. And also better to keep mobile away from body while sleeping and not too close to the body. SO 6/10
+The phone does heat up while using high end games, but I havent experience it while continuous use of wifi. And there are many awesome features present in this phone which makes the usage of this phone really good.
+I have heard the after sales service of Lenovo is good, so that will be a relief if something bad happens. This is really a good phone and I recommend using this. The only people I don’t recommend is who require the usage of this phone for continuous and long calls daily. Totally the phone is 9/10. Last but not the least I’m sorry for a large review but I wanted to give my full experience about this phone. Will try to update the review or create a new one after using it for 1-3 months.
+Review after 5days use
+I know peoples like me look for reviews before buy i will tell you everything clearly..
+Performance is fantastic no lag till now and it was super speed
+It gets little warm after playing games for 30mins not heavy bt little warm
+When coming to "Display" Here where it wins more than its perfomance , When u r in crowd people will luk at your mobile for sure for its stunning display and butter smooth touch
+Charged my mobile 100% at saturday and then i charge it back at tuesday morning while it was 25% i made calls used wifi and data for update and app installations in between..
+camera here it has bad reviews and it was true , i know that well but i have a gud DSLR so i dont want a best mobile to be with best camera and at this price too it cant be.. if u want a gud camera it k3 cant be your choice but if luk for performance, display etc nothing can beat k3 in this range thats for sure so far...
+so think well before u buy..
+If camera is your 1st option then k3 is not for u..
+If peoples like me who luks for beautiful display ,stylish design , light weight , gud performance without any lag u can buy k3 blindly..there willl be new mobiles coming day by day with pros and cons on each.. among them k3 has cons on camera alone.. aahh i forgot to mention its audio effect through headset was mind blowing u il love to hear your fav songs because of its dolby atmos app.. (note :- i bought mi headset seperately ) os also gud everything is gud nothing is there to say bad about it other than camera (note :- only rear camera bad front camera is gud for selfie)
+Trusted Review
+After Using this phone for about three days. These are my views about it.
+Amazing, Looks good. Clarity is great and you can adjust the tone according to your taste. But the ambient light sensor doesnt work properly in low lit areas and show weird response. Might be a software glitch that may improve with update. Another thing i noticed after using phone a lot, the touch response starts loosing sense in lower portion of screen. Might be its in my phone or software issue.
+Rear speaker is loud and has enough clarity. Use better earphones and u will love the sound through atmos software in the phone.
+Its clear with good reception and clarity. Just the sound through ear piece is bit low to my liking.
+Didnt face any headache or anything. Does heat at ear piece if u accept calls while its charging.
+Both rear and front camera are good not the best. Takes good pictures even in low light. But ur hand should be sturdy or u would get blurred images. No image stabilization. Videos taken are good but no touch to focus sometimes create a mess.
+Battery and Charging: Battery lasts a full day if u are a moderate user with all settings at on. Heavy user can accept charging at evening. 5 hrs of screen on time is good
+When storage is set to phone no apps can store data to sd card and when storage set to sd card. sd card is ur primary memory and all data saved to sd card. Even whatsapp data. phone storage remains intact.
+Thats all. Its a best phone if ur budget is 10k. Decide as per ur needs and this review.
+Awsome phone with great performance
+This is the best phone under 10k price tag. I like the look and feel of the phone which is way better than a 10k budget phone , the phone is amazingly light weight, which some people like and some don't, the performance is the best part of this mobile , its silky smooth whatever is thrown onto that processor it just does the job pretty smoothly, the only thing i am little worried is its battery, its 2900mah which could be a little more than 3k mah. The disappointing thing in the phone is that i expected a better camera. The camera is just above average.
+Other than camera everything is awesome in this phone.
+Some new features have been introduced in this model like wide touch, we do not have to use the lock button. The UI is designed very well and it looks fluidic. The touch is also super smooth.
+U can just go for it
+Not a killer phone
+Edit review
+Returned phone - Had a manufacturing defect because of which had to return the phone. The photo which looked crisp on the phone, looked pixelated when veiwed on a laptop/desktop - the camera is extrapolated. Re-rating this phone - a bit disappointed !!
+After two weeks of use, here's sharing my experience :
+The phone is wonderful at first sight. Its really light-weight for a 5.5 inch screen and 2900 mah battery (yes not 3000 !!) with a great display, including the screen to body ratio. Colours are nice and vibrant. In the box you would find the usb cable with adapater along with a free screen guard - it does not have any Gorilla glass protection and no headphones (bad) !! It takes a lot to remove the battery - a real fight it is !! The hardware is heavily packed but the os and the bloatwares (mostly from google itself) takes away some shine. Around 10.5 GB is available and these cannot be moved to SD card (inspite of having Lolipop. Lenovo still has not provided users with the latest version which allows the apps to be moved to sd card). Moreover, inspite of a 2GB of RAM, only 600-700 mb at max is available. Thankfully there's no lag, even with high end games but need to clear it from the recent menu once you are out of the game. Rear is great with crisp and sharp pictures. However, the 5mp multi-featured front cam trumps in this category - selfie kings/queens would love it !! The phone does have some nice and useful features which many would find useful, the power saver especially is brilliant, as also some other smart feaures. With heavy usage, battery would hardly last a day but with low to medium usage, battery would last more than a day specially with the above feature tunred on as and when required. The phone heats up on medium outdoor usage and when you play high end games (understandbly because its octa core) at the point right below the camera (guess that's where the cpu is). The sound section is overall VERY BAD - speaker phone is decent but the ring tone cannot be heard even from the next room. While speaking, if you hold the phone at 30-35 degrees or even far, the person on the other side would barely be able to hear you as if you are speaking from the border!! The 3.5 mm jack is the biggest trick of Lenovo which does not allow other earphones to be jacked in (sounds like Apple isn't it ?). No accessories available yet, not sure if the one's for A7000 would fit, even Flipkart execs could not assist. One big problem I have faced is with the proximity sensor not working properly. Long duration calls easily ensures a lot of background apps being initiated due to the sensor not working properly - needs a big update to fix all these. Overall, for the price tag
+KPROS AND CONS
+Pros
+big screen
+display
+touch response
+Cons
+battery lasts 1 day on average usage (from 9am to 9pm)
+feel hot at ears while calling
+heating while playing
+A very good device for the Price
+as many of the reviewers have stated before me how great the device is. i will not go into the details much but will point out some pros and cons of this phablet and compare it with my oneplus one
+lets start with the pros of K3 note.
+Display, the display is crisp and vivid, its accurate and the colour reproduction is accurate. the viewing angles are good but not great. you will not find a reason to complain and there is a option to boost display brightness in sunlight under settings. it needs to be tested as i have not seen the sun due to rains in past 2 days of getting device.
+Build is good and the soft touch back is nice to hold, its same build and look of A6000, A7000 and i do not see the reason to complain the vol and power buttons are metal and thats good.
+Sensors which are needed are present, you have double tap to wake and gesture controls. there is no tap to sleep. i admire the fact that lenovo has given proper sensors and led notification light. it has gyro, accelerometer, magnetometer, orientation sensor, gravity sensor, light and proximity sensor and all of them work well.
+mpx front facing camera is good, it has beauty shot and 13mpx rear camera is decent. it can be compared to M1 Note and One+ camera and i assure you lenovo K3 camera is than meizu M1 note and on par with oneplus camera
+both sims support 4G which is good thing and the network strength and call quality is good. i can say that voice quality over the earpiece is better than oneplus one. the rear speaker is good too, better than Mi4I and has good depth of voice. there is no distortion of sound. loudness is lower than oneplus and A6000 plus but better than M1 Note from meizu and Mi 4I.
+WIFI and tethering have good range, in my house the last room gets very low signal strength but K3 note was showing 1 or 2 bars where other mobile like Oneplus either drop wifi or show just a dot. speed over cellular network is very good.
+GPU is Mali T760 MP2, which will let you play any game in playstore without a issue. but the thing here is the same GPU performs better in A7000 as it has less pixels to push on screen. i have noticed some lag and drops in frame in some heavy games like asphalt 8, NOVA while they play better on A7000.
+Touch is good and i would say better than A6000+ which i was using earlier and i would say touch response is better than One.
