+Review after using k3 note for 38 days got on first sale.
+Review after using k3 note for 38 days.
+I boughtt k3 note in 1st flash sale (8th july) and delivered on 11th july. My Antutu performance is 43653, which is very good.
+First thing is Software update - Please update it with 17 MB, don't go for 296 MB update otherwise you may face some Heating or wifi or Battery backup issue. I have the 17 mb update in my system and facing no problem at all many are reporting to have problem. So its better wait for few days.
+Display hd crisp display, pixel control is awesome, Viewing angle very good. you are getting a dual core graphics processor which is powered by mali-T760MP2 i.e. the latest battery efficient, powerful graphics card ever even from adreno..
+Processorlenovo has given true octa core means all the cores have been clocked to 1.7 ghz which is rare in other brands. All other octacore mobiles doesn't give the core by same clock-work power.
+Gaming You can play Heavy games like Asphalt 8 without any lag.
+UI Inbuilt VIVE UI is good but not the best one. Better wait for vibe's latest version, will be released this month.
+Dolby ATMOS if you have a JBL, SONY, Beats, PHILLPS etc (reputed company headphones) you are going to blast with the dolby atmos feature. Ram - 2 GB ram with a DDR3 quality means it can give the boost of a 2.5gb at max work-load, which is again an extra benefit from lenovo. out of 2 GB you will get around 900 MB free.
+ROM 16 GB internal with a free space of 11+ GB enough to load heavy games and data..
+LTE both the sim-slot support 4G lte
+SAR rating It has SAR rating of 1.59W/kg which is same as
+Camera Primary cam is good enough and the SLR option is an advantage. As a smartphone photographer the device is very good but in low light a bit crappy but adjustable. Front cam is good for selfies but the beauty option soften the pics Focal length is 3.54 mm.
+Battery 900 mAh Good enough to stand 1 full day with 1 hr gaming (like Asphalt 8), 1 hr video, full day wifi, mobile data, 30 min call, 4 hrs music
+No such major problems observed yet
+UI preinstalled apps are little awkward but you can easily unistall it.
+Themes Should provide more options to download themes.
+Heating a mobile with this much specs can heat a liitle. its not a issue becoz i know the facts
+Overall its value for money product, FULLY PAISA VASOOL
+Hi I bought this product on 8th July which was the 1st flash sale.
+The phone seems to be fine and so are the features, only concern being the high SAR value. Also the Product was delivered on time.
+The phone worked fine for the first 12 days. But then I noticed that the battery would drain within a few hours of charging and post that the battery just gave up.
+Tried using another battery to switch the phone on and the phone works just fine.
+I am surprised that Lenovo is providing such poor quality products and flipkart backing them up.
+I will now have to either return the product to flipkart or search a Lenovo service station hoping for them to replace the battery.
+This mostly will be my last purchase from flipkart and lenovo
+Will update post my interaction with Lenovo service station.
+Best phone in range of 9999 and awesome features .
+Pros: Full HD Screen
+Camera 13 MP with great Quality
+Faster than any other phone
+Long Battery life
+And much more
+Best phone to buy today don't miss next sell
+Problem with lenovo k3
+heat and draining the battery and you can feel heat while talking to phone, you can feel this in 2 min. After starting the call. I can say this is bad design because charging port is at top of the phone near to ear piece. This should be at mic
+Best Brand and Specs phone at this price
+Pros
+Fantastic upgrade in terms of brand, configuration and best value for money.
+Camera quality is amazing.
+Cons:
+Don't see any Cons after buying this phone.
+Heating Tooo Badly

+thanks for flipkart for one day delivery
+thanks to airtel for 4g free 4g sim....
+specs are good but Having issues really worried about having future complaints
+I ordered it on 9/7/2015 and flipkart delivered it to me on 13/07/2015. 13 Mp rear camera is good but 5 Mp front camera is average. Display is good. Battery back is not great as i charged it and used 1 hour for seeing the performance it went down to 70%. Heating issues while using internet and playing games within 30 minutes. Really worried about phone getting complaints in the future. So I am using it very cautiously. Usually I heard good responses for lenovo phones so i purchased my first Lenovo Phone but my expedition regarding the product was not very much pleasing after using it.
+Awesome phone to own if you plan to by 5.5 inch
+I bought this phone on 1st flash sale and following are my observartions using it for 1 days.
+PROS
+1. Light weight.All the persons who checked my mobile was surprised of light weight it was.Good weight distibution
+Audio quality-Very crisp and clear with dolby audio(Tested with sennheiser CX 275 s).
+Display: Full HD and it was Awesome experince.Tried watching HD video and it was like wow. Similar to Sony Bravia display phones .

+Games: Plays all high end games smoothly .
+Camera: Front camera is awesome for selfies.Back camera is very nice compared to other sub 10k phones.

+Myself Installed Lolipop launcher and now you will not miss app launcher.
+Amps charger and it looks sturdy and good in the price segment.
+Need improvement for camera on low lit areas and indoor
+Minimum 1 GB Ram is always occupied for OS and preinstalled Apps.
+Battery backup is ok .keeps it for 1 day after using 3.5 hours of wifi and internet.If i continuously use for 6 hours of wifi and 3g, it will be finished.
+But all PROS shadows the cons.Go for it blindly.
+COMPARISON with Honor 4x
+Advantages for Lenovo K3
+Premium looks

+Disadvantages:
+Camera.
+WLAN GIVING AUTHENTICATION PROBLEM
+Well I was pretty excited for my phone and it worked out to be nice...

+CONS
+gaming
+camera
+and a lot of pre-loaded apps make it worse.
+Then out of 2GB ram it always shows ~700mb....and
+then Since today tenth day of usage it stopped connecting with the WIFI...i checked it with 3 different routers and i have authentication issues.Well I've filed a return and let see what assistance will flipkart assign me
+Lenovo K3 Note...
+Hii guys, thanks for such a nice phone launched by Lenovo company.
+The delivery service was very bad by the delivery man, delivered the package on committed time, but without contacting or informing the about the delivery time.
+Secondly the Lenovo K3 Note phone is overall good, no issues and smooth functioning software's and applications.
+Now the real issue is, the device is getting over heat even if you do not browse the internet or else you if you don't play a game also. Just browsing the phone menu makes the phone over heat, which is something needs to be sort out the by the Lenovo Technical engineers to resolve the heating issue.
+Thirdly the battery power drains very fast, after charged to a 100% full and even after using the function of battery saver power.
+I charged the phone 100% full in evening, guess what after an hour, the battery power drop to 88% without making any calls, browsing the internet, playing games and even on standby mode also.
+I really don't understand, the company promises of long battery life atleast for 1 full day and which is something worst.
+You can also not use the external sd card applications at the same time owhen using internal memory, if you acces anyone of the memory, you'll not be able to use some of the applications such as google play store with proper wifi and internet connection.
+Lastly, when I unboxed the phone the screenguard which came with the handset was of low quality and was not sticking to the screen.
+Please make sure the readers, who are planning to buy this Lenovo K3 Note phone think thrice and then only buy the phone.
+Got a defective phone
+Facing following issues with the new K3 note phone bought from Flipkart:
+There is some problem with the microphone as during the call the other person is not able to hear anything, so it is not doing the most basic function what a phone is supposed to do. Don't know how can Lenovo ship such products to customers without testing properly.
+Phone is getting heat up within few minutes of using.
+Battery of the phone is so tight that it takes lot of effort to take out. You cannot take it out using your fingers or nails and have to use some other sharp object and lot of time and effort to pull out.
+have immediately put a return request to Flipkart for replacing the device but their process is taking too much time and I expect it is still going to take lot of time.Really frustrated with the overall experience.
+People who are considering to buy K3 note, I would advise to consider some other phone if you do not want to go through any hassles as mentioned above.
+Worst Mobile & Worst Service from Flipkart
+I have purchase first time mobile from flipkart.
+Performance of Lenovo K3 note is very bad.
+Mobile getting hanged while operarating appilcation.
+Battery getting low without use of mobile.
+Mobile switch of automatically.
+Really an Awesome Phone!!!!!
+After one week of using Lenovo K3.
+First thing first!!!!
+Got my Phone on-time.
+Nice features. It equals a 30k worth mobile.
+Valuable & worth for the money!!!!!
+after one week of using.
+Good Display
+Good battery withstand capacity.
+Usable for average gaming but minor lags in high end games.
+OTG-support superb!!!!
+Able to connect USB joystick and wireless keyboard and mouse.
+Good internet speed.
+Call clarity good.
+Double tap to wake feature.
+Access camera when device is locked using the volume keys and take pictures.
+GPS accuracy lags.
+System itself occupies 1GB of RAM.
+Sometime disabling internet from the lock screen doesn't work even though the icon shows as disabled.
+Doesn't supports dual band 802.11 b/g/n/ac. 5Ghz is not working in wifi.
+The 3.5mm audio jack doesn't really fit for the headsets.
+Rest...Its a good Phone.... Value for MOney!!!
+Go for it!!!!
+Any phone will be in rectangle shape of course few phones are available in Square shape as well. Cause our pockets are Rectangle/Square shape :P
+So Design of phone wont be a concern. By the way Size and Weight of the phone is OK (5.5 Inch & 150 Grams)
+Battery
+Removable 3000 mAh battery (Its a Power Beast Battery which lasts at least 24hrs ON Full with Wi-Fi/3G/4G)
+Performance
+Its a 2GB RAM @1.7 GHz + Cortex-A53--- this processor runs fast @ smooth performance.
+Graphics chip is ARM Mali-T760 which is latest technology and its mainly used for the Games & watching Animation Videos of Superb quality.
+Special Feature: 5/5
+Its a Full HD (1920 x 1080 Pixels) IPS display phone. Screen Viewing at this resolution will be AWESOME.
+Sound Enhancement - Dolby Atmos - To enjoy this feature One should have a Branded Headphones so that every bit of music will be enjoyed with this "Dolby Atmos" feature.
+Camera
+13MP primary and 5 MP Rear(Front) Cam.
+I heard a lot many NEGATIVE reviews about the CAM for most the mobiles. It's not the fault of the Mobile CAM it's a problem with the MOBILE Owners, they take a snap and expect the Quality should be of DSLR :P.
+If you want a Descent Pic then go for "HDR" mode, here the condition is "Both the Object and CAM should be Steady" then you will get a AWESOME Pic :D
+If you want to cover a Long area then go for "Panorama" Mode. here the condition is "Both the Object and CAM should be in LINE" then you will get a Long Awesome Pic :D
+Overall
+What else your looking @9999 price range.
+This is the BEST phone from all perspectives ust GO

+Best phone to buy today don't miss next sell
+Worthy product for 10K but nor a Killer Note
+I own Galaxy Note3 N900. I was waiting for OnePlus 2. But could not resist my urge to try out the well hyped 'Killer Note' for 10K.
+I am going to compare it with Note 3(current cost Rs 30K, cost when I bought Rs 45K!)
+Display: I didn't expect the display to be good. But, it is vivid and pleasure to use though the contrast can never be compared with AMOLED display. This is the best part of K3 Note.
+Camera: OK camera. Bit laggy and lot of over processing done . For selfies it seems to be better than Galaxy Note 3
+Performance: No issues and lags in regular use. But, you can see the occasional frame drops when there is lot of IO(like update or install of apps in the BG). I see this in a Galaxy Note 3 as well. But never try to use features like Secure zone and expect it to perform. It lags like hell when you enable secure zone. 2GB RAM is not enough for this feature.
+The main reason I wanted to get this phone. Hell with Sammy for not giving LTE in Note 3. 4G speed I saw with Airtel was 11Mbps download - must faster than 3Mbps I used to get in 3G
+Battery: I got only 2900mah battery(minimum spec). Not sure who gets the 3000mah battery. If most of the pieces shiped with 2900 better to update teh spec with 2900mah instead of 3000mah. It is too early to comment on the battery. But my initial use shows similar battery performance as Note 3. Yet to load all my apps.
+Software: Better than Touchwiz. But there are bloat-wares in this as well. But, there will be stable CM for K3 Note in couple of months. Note 3, yet to get a stable CM and Note 5 is expected in couple of months.
+Sound: The speaker is not loud as I would expect. Sure to miss calls in bit noisy places. Sound quality even with headphones is average. Not bad as well is not good.
+Sensors: Has all important sensors. Additional FM is good compared to Note3. But I may miss IR blaster. Wont miss: NFC, Gesture,Humidity,Pressure & Temperature sensors of Note 3.
+Build:OK build quality & feel. Almost same size as Note 3 but bit lighter.
+ottom-line:
+Is it a good purchase for someone looking for a phablet: Definitely Yes.
+Will it replace my Note 3: No. I will wait for OnePlus 2
+My experience with this aweosme phone(K3Note)
+I have given 5 stars in my review because I liked the phone and it meets my expectations. This doesn’t mean this phone is perfect. It has its flaws but I haven’t found any major flaws. I will give the detail of the flaws also in my review.
+The delivery from flipkart (also WS retail) was really good. It was packed well. The delivery guy also prompted to open the box and check for the item.
+I bought the mobile in the first flash sale, and have read most reviews on this phone here in flipkart. It has been more than 15 days since I have been using it.
+Now coming to the phone specifications, it is certainly a killer note. For the 10k price range it is one of the best phones I have seen.
+It is lightweight and easy to hold. The design is awesome and looks really good. The phone comes with a removable battery (Which is what I wanted). Hence it made of body connected to phone and a plastic cover. The plastic cover looks weak and sometimes there is a little problem of shaking. But once it gets practiced, both these don’t look like problem. Screen doesn’t come with gorilla glass but I don’t think it matters much other than giving confidence. And yah I accidentally dropped the phone once from 3 feet and nothing happened. It had a back cover, but still. So build will be 8/10.
+The 5.5 inch Full HD display is really awesome. The quality is just superb. Touch is also smooth. No lag in the touch. Though display takes a lot of the battery there are some methods to reduce battery consumption. So 10/10
+This is the first smartphone I own ( But I have used many other smartphones for long durations like HTC One M8, Asus Zenfone 5, Samsung Galaxy Grand, Micromax Canvas HD). The nokia mobiles which I used before had to be charged once in 2-5 days, but I’ll have to charge this daily. Yet, the battery performance of this phone is not bad. With medium usage( Wifi for about 10 hours, a little gaming(asphalt, jumping tiles) ) it comes for a little more than a day. There many good options to reduce battery consumption(Ultra power saver) so 2900mAH battery is not that bad as many reviews portray. So 8/10
+This is one part that many complain. But it depends on what u like. Even if u don’t like, there tons of launcher to download. So no worry in this department.
+This is one of the parts which I feared before buying the phone. Antutu readings showed 45k+ which is really awesome. After buying I checked the score many times and it came 45k+ everytime. Though this are a little different from normal usage, the phone’s performance for apps and usage is also superb. Good response, no lags. Out of the 2GB ram, it shows about 700-1000mb available without any apps and 400-600mb with usage fo upto 11 apps together. One thing that I have found that even though it shows less, there is not much problem. It releases ram from system memory if high usage Is required.( for example when I had 4 apps running in the background it showed 520mb free. I opened asphalt and started playing. It usually uses min of 300-500mb of ram so I guessed it would lag or show around 0-200 mb free. But when I checked it showed 450mb.) So totally awesome performance and hence it is a killer note. It has not lagged for me till now even when using asphalt8. So 10/10.
+This is also one thing that many are complaining and I cannot blame them. They expected really good quality with 13/5, but this camera is not that good. It’s not bad, but not the best. Still good use for those who click photos for memory, fun and not professionalism. So 8/10
+This is the worst thing about this phone. The SAR value is 1.590 whereas standards Is less than 1.6. SO it is quite high. It will be a problem if you are on calls for about an hour. Better to use earphones in such cases. Otherwise it might not pose much problems. And also better to keep mobile away from body while sleeping and not too close to the body. SO 6/10
+The phone does heat up while using high end games, but I havent experience it while continuous use of wifi. And there are many awesome features present in this phone which makes the usage of this phone really good.
+I have heard the after sales service of Lenovo is good, so that will be a relief if something bad happens. This is really a good phone and I recommend using this. The only people I don’t recommend is who require the usage of this phone for continuous and long calls daily. Totally the phone is 9/10. Last but not the least I’m sorry for a large review but I wanted to give my full experience about this phone. Will try to update the review or create a new one after using it for 1-3 months.
+Review after 5days use
+I know peoples like me look for reviews before buy i will tell you everything clearly..
+Performance is fantastic no lag till now and it was super speed
+It gets little warm after playing games for 30mins not heavy bt little warm
+When coming to "Display" Here where it wins more than its perfomance , When u r in crowd people will luk at your mobile for sure for its stunning display and butter smooth touch
+Charged my mobile 100% at saturday and then i charge it back at tuesday morning while it was 25% i made calls used wifi and data for update and app installations in between..
+camera here it has bad reviews and it was true , i know that well but i have a gud DSLR so i dont want a best mobile to be with best camera and at this price too it cant be.. if u want a gud camera it k3 cant be your choice but if luk for performance, display etc nothing can beat k3 in this range thats for sure so far...
+so think well before u buy..
+If camera is your 1st option then k3 is not for u..
+If peoples like me who luks for beautiful display ,stylish design , light weight , gud performance without any lag u can buy k3 blindly..there willl be new mobiles coming day by day with pros and cons on each.. among them k3 has cons on camera alone.. aahh i forgot to mention its audio effect through headset was mind blowing u il love to hear your fav songs because of its dolby atmos app.. (note :- i bought mi headset seperately ) os also gud everything is gud nothing is there to say bad about it other than camera (note :- only rear camera bad front camera is gud for selfie)
+Trusted Review
+After Using this phone for about three days. These are my views about it.
+Amazing, Looks good. Clarity is great and you can adjust the tone according to your taste. But the ambient light sensor doesnt work properly in low lit areas and show weird response. Might be a software glitch that may improve with update. Another thing i noticed after using phone a lot, the touch response starts loosing sense in lower portion of screen. Might be its in my phone or software issue.
+Rear speaker is loud and has enough clarity. Use better earphones and u will love the sound through atmos software in the phone.
+Its clear with good reception and clarity. Just the sound through ear piece is bit low to my liking.
+Didnt face any headache or anything. Does heat at ear piece if u accept calls while its charging.
+Both rear and front camera are good not the best. Takes good pictures even in low light. But ur hand should be sturdy or u would get blurred images. No image stabilization. Videos taken are good but no touch to focus sometimes create a mess.
+Battery and Charging: Battery lasts a full day if u are a moderate user with all settings at on. Heavy user can accept charging at evening. 5 hrs of screen on time is good
+When storage is set to phone no apps can store data to sd card and when storage set to sd card. sd card is ur primary memory and all data saved to sd card. Even whatsapp data. phone storage remains intact.
+Thats all. Its a best phone if ur budget is 10k. Decide as per ur needs and this review.
+Awsome phone with great performance
+This is the best phone under 10k price tag. I like the look and feel of the phone which is way better than a 10k budget phone , the phone is amazingly light weight, which some people like and some don't, the performance is the best part of this mobile , its silky smooth whatever is thrown onto that processor it just does the job pretty smoothly, the only thing i am little worried is its battery, its 2900mah which could be a little more than 3k mah. The disappointing thing in the phone is that i expected a better camera. The camera is just above average.
+Other than camera everything is awesome in this phone.
+Some new features have been introduced in this model like wide touch, we do not have to use the lock button. The UI is designed very well and it looks fluidic. The touch is also super smooth.
+U can just go for it
+Not a killer phone
+Edit review
+Returned phone - Had a manufacturing defect because of which had to return the phone. The photo which looked crisp on the phone, looked pixelated when veiwed on a laptop/desktop - the camera is extrapolated. Re-rating this phone - a bit disappointed !!
+After two weeks of use, here's sharing my experience :
+The phone is wonderful at first sight. Its really light-weight for a 5.5 inch screen and 2900 mah battery (yes not 3000 !!) with a great display, including the screen to body ratio. Colours are nice and vibrant. In the box you would find the usb cable with adapater along with a free screen guard - it does not have any Gorilla glass protection and no headphones (bad) !! It takes a lot to remove the battery - a real fight it is !! The hardware is heavily packed but the os and the bloatwares (mostly from google itself) takes away some shine. Around 10.5 GB is available and these cannot be moved to SD card (inspite of having Lolipop. Lenovo still has not provided users with the latest version which allows the apps to be moved to sd card). Moreover, inspite of a 2GB of RAM, only 600-700 mb at max is available. Thankfully there's no lag, even with high end games but need to clear it from the recent menu once you are out of the game. Rear is great with crisp and sharp pictures. However, the 5mp multi-featured front cam trumps in this category - selfie kings/queens would love it !! The phone does have some nice and useful features which many would find useful, the power saver especially is brilliant, as also some other smart feaures. With heavy usage, battery would hardly last a day but with low to medium usage, battery would last more than a day specially with the above feature tunred on as and when required. The phone heats up on medium outdoor usage and when you play high end games (understandbly because its octa core) at the point right below the camera (guess that's where the cpu is). The sound section is overall VERY BAD - speaker phone is decent but the ring tone cannot be heard even from the next room. While speaking, if you hold the phone at 30-35 degrees or even far, the person on the other side would barely be able to hear you as if you are speaking from the border!! The 3.5 mm jack is the biggest trick of Lenovo which does not allow other earphones to be jacked in (sounds like Apple isn't it ?). No accessories available yet, not sure if the one's for A7000 would fit, even Flipkart execs could not assist. One big problem I have faced is with the proximity sensor not working properly. Long duration calls easily ensures a lot of background apps being initiated due to the sensor not working properly - needs a big update to fix all these. Overall, for the price tag
+KPROS AND CONS
+Pros
+big screen
+display
+touch response
+Cons
+battery lasts 1 day on average usage (from 9am to 9pm)
+feel hot at ears while calling
+heating while playing
+A very good device for the Price
+as many of the reviewers have stated before me how great the device is. i will not go into the details much but will point out some pros and cons of this phablet and compare it with my oneplus one
+lets start with the pros of K3 note.
+Display, the display is crisp and vivid, its accurate and the colour reproduction is accurate. the viewing angles are good but not great. you will not find a reason to complain and there is a option to boost display brightness in sunlight under settings. it needs to be tested as i have not seen the sun due to rains in past 2 days of getting device.
+Build is good and the soft touch back is nice to hold, its same build and look of A6000, A7000 and i do not see the reason to complain the vol and power buttons are metal and thats good.
+Sensors which are needed are present, you have double tap to wake and gesture controls. there is no tap to sleep. i admire the fact that lenovo has given proper sensors and led notification light. it has gyro, accelerometer, magnetometer, orientation sensor, gravity sensor, light and proximity sensor and all of them work well.
+mpx front facing camera is good, it has beauty shot and 13mpx rear camera is decent. it can be compared to M1 Note and One+ camera and i assure you lenovo K3 camera is than meizu M1 note and on par with oneplus camera
+both sims support 4G which is good thing and the network strength and call quality is good. i can say that voice quality over the earpiece is better than oneplus one. the rear speaker is good too, better than Mi4I and has good depth of voice. there is no distortion of sound. loudness is lower than oneplus and A6000 plus but better than M1 Note from meizu and Mi 4I.
+WIFI and tethering have good range, in my house the last room gets very low signal strength but K3 note was showing 1 or 2 bars where other mobile like Oneplus either drop wifi or show just a dot. speed over cellular network is very good.
+GPU is Mali T760 MP2, which will let you play any game in playstore without a issue. but the thing here is the same GPU performs better in A7000 as it has less pixels to push on screen. i have noticed some lag and drops in frame in some heavy games like asphalt 8, NOVA while they play better on A7000.
+Touch is good and i would say better than A6000+ which i was using earlier and i would say touch response is better than One.
