-Now coming to CONS
-the device is very good but not the perfect device as it could have been.
-the look is similar to A7000 and the design is now old, all the A6000, A6000+, A7000 and K3 note are same design.
-also the back on K3 note is less rigid than one on A6000+
-SAR ratings are the highest on any device seen in recent times, its almost at the allowed limit.
-allowed limit in India is 1.6 w/kg and K3 note has 1.59 w/kg. very high.
-dont get this device if you talk a lot on your cell phone.
-i am quite suprised that no one talks about this
-there is no protection on glass like corning or dragontrail, the glass is hardned glass as per what customer support told me but its a finger print magnet and it does get scratched quite easily as i have seen on A7000. get a tempered glass of good quality
-The dolby atmos does not work with every music, i dont see any change in music when dolby is on or off.
-also the quality through headphones is not good. i tried it with different headphones.
-Vibe UI is not that good, it feels like a half baked version of android with missing features.
-for instance there is no option to edit lock screen or the notification lights depending on your choice. nothing 3rd party launcher or lightflow wont fix
-Battery and heating.
-well i would say 2 days is not enough but using both sims and wifi always on, i am seeing battery life is not that great.
-its decent but i would say that i am getting much higher battery life on my oneplus and when playing games, it does heat up a bit. dont get me wrong its not very hot but it does heat up to around 44 - 47C. the biggest issue for me is the screen heats up too and using device for call is hard then. dont expect it to run cool but it will not heat up a lot.
-RAM optimization needs rework, on first boot you will get around 950 mb but i have seen fore close of apps when multi tasking.
-its a issue with software and not hardware.
-Final say,
-i would say if your usage is more towards multimedia consumption and using device to chat of social sites along with some casual gaming then at this price, you have no other option. there will be some heating but it beats all other devices in under 12K bracket. if you use this as primary device and take lot of calls, be safe and get something else as it has very high SAR value which you should take note of.
-Lenovo voids warranty when you root or install custom OS
-Lenovo K3 Note Camera
-Not good quality of rear and front
-and
-5mp front qualitty is like 2 mp
-not satisfacted
-if u are a heavy game lover then my humble request is not to buy this mobile.just received mobile yesterday and switched on it and i installed asphalt 8, what i noticed is it is lagging which will not let u enjoy the game at all and iam very much disappointed with this. even clash of clan is also lagging. it is only recommended for those who wont play much games and use for calling(max)
-pros:good battery
-large internal memory
-large screen
-cons:bad bad camera,
-it clearly lags,u will definitely hate this,
-heating problem
-Killer Note, Yes, its ready to kill you.
-Its a piece of crap, Heats like an iron box over the ear, and wifi stops working in the middle,
-For heating issue the answer they have is "battery is still less than 45Deg so normal sir"
-Flipkart Idiots, I am taking using earpiece, not with battery. And I ordered a phone ,not an Iron box.
-Wifi issue, Its a common issue, the wifi chip is not stable, so you have to adjust with it.
-Its worth buying with little risk
-I was using Mi 3 which I bought on first batch sale, It is one of the most beautiful and awesome proforming mobile.
-This time on first sale I bought LENOVO K3 note, It didnt disappoint me in terms of value for money.
-Good things.
-Nice Built quality.
-Superb music quality.
-Very handy to use even with 5.5 inch screen.
-Awasome UI
-Not Good things.
-Battery back up is very bad.
-Its getting heat while watching youtube videos and front camera.
-In last one week usage it got hanged once, I am scared.
-ime will Tell - which is the best phone of them all
-The price.
-Did I mention the price?
-The back camera is among the best in a phone in this price range.
-A decent number of options, a good stabilization mechanism (albeit manual).
-The HDR option doesn't instantly make your photos better like the one on the Nexus 5, but it does a good enough job of highlighting contrasts and brightening what needs to be brightened. Although it leaves lots to be desired when compared to, say, the camera on the Oneplus One. That thing's a beast! I may be biased here, because I just love the Oneplus One cameras - both front and back.
-It's light and looks way better in reality than it does in the pictures. Black and sleek.
-The back cover is a little plastic-y, but it's matte and looks good.
-Huge battery. 50% has lasted me 5 hours now, being used as much as a normal phone would be.
-With wifi on and everything.
-It's on charge now.
-It's got expandable storage.
-It's one of the few new phones which has a removable battery.
-No excessive heating issues or system / app crashes so far.
-The price. Come on, it costs 10k.
-Does not suport automatic sms internet settings - found out to my dismay from the Vodafone IVR system.
-Excessive amounts of bloatware including 4 games, the Flipkart app (cheap move there, Flipkart), a navigation app whose name I've forgotten since deleting it and a pretty useless note-taking application that, for some reason, refuses to work without you logging into it.
-You will have about 700MB of usable RAM, once you clear out all background processes - the majority of it seems to be getting eaten up by the un-friendly interface.
-The quick-access drag-down settings are cramped together worse than you would be on a Mumbai local, with many tiny icons that are squashed together.
-I have no shortage of complaints about the cluttered, RAM-hungry UI that Lenovo has used in the K3 Note.
-It just serves to make the phone slower, and with just 2GB RAM, that's no something they could afford to do.
-The call screen also seems really cluttered with buttons everywhere. Useful in a way, but aesthetically unappealing - if you give stock by such a thing.
-The front camera is pathetic, 5 megapixels maybe, but slow, blurry and unable to capture a decent still image even with the slightest of movement. No sharpness to speak of, and I'm sure my face isn't all that blurry.
-The phone isn't the fastest thing available, nor the sturdiest, but considering the price and bang-for-buck value - it's among the best out there. It uses quality components that will last, but I think has skimped on the RAM. Could've used another 1GB for the kind of apps that are being released lately, and the kind of multitasking that's being demanded off of phones today. If you're on a budget and are deciding between phones of the same congifuration, however, buy this one. You will not be disappointed till you save enough to invest in one of the bigger, faster phones with more processing power.
-I'm not too certain the phone is as industry-smashing, flagship-killing and other-brand-beating as its 10k pricetag, though.
-Only time will tell.
-I am very much satisfied with phone, but from the minute I received (09-10-2015),
-I am not using much except phone calls for maximum 45 mins in a day, but battery lasts for only maximum of 14 hrs and today
-I recharged 100% for 2 times.
-I am unable to use data connection from 2nd sim. Don't know why.
-Its heating while charging and in call.
-Is anybody facing these issues?
-Kindly let me know, if I am the one, I will proceed further.
-Hi Friends,
-This is a overall product it have some demerits like:
-Back cover is very poor quality.
-very poor quality rear camera as compared to other phone camera as per 13 mp.
-resolution is not good whenever zoom a picture.
-this phone is very weight less not like 150 g.
-Not given earphone with this product this is big issue also.
-The SAR value is very high as per the govt of India permitted,not good for health.
-Screen quality is also very poor.
-Sound is very slow when set below 70% volume control.
-flipkart can't fulfil delivery comttment as per given time.
-flipkart shows 3000mah battery in specification page but actually it is 2900mah.
-so finally friends don't buy this phone as per price.
-Average 4G Mobile. Redmi 4G Note is better with average rating of 4.1
-After waiting for 2 years I brought K3 looking at the brand during the first sale and felt lucky to grab it but after almost 1 month to certain extent I am disappointed. I would rate it at 3. Wished I would have bought Redmi 4G Note instead with 2K less and additional 1K with exchange.
-Light weight.
-Wide viewing angle and good screen clarity.
-Rear Camera is awesome in light but decreases clarity in low light. LED Flash is good.
-Dolby Atmos is good provided you have high end Headset like Skull Candy for which you would need to spend another 500 Rs +.
-Connectivity is good but depends on your network provider.
-Phone heats up even after playing Candy Crush for 15 mins.
-Front camera though a 5MP is pathetic. My Nokia E5 at 5MP is excellent.
-Sometime after unlocking the phone the full screen is black with only icons visible. No trace of Theme and wallpaper.
-No headset.
-Comes with useless Apps which cant be uninstalled sometimes and use the RAM.
-Only ~850MB is available of the 2GB RAM.
-Screen guard is pathetic. When I complained to flipkart they added 200 Rs in my wallet only to know that I cant use that as WS Retail does not sell accessories.
-Compare Redmi 4G Note with K3 and then decide which one is good.
-Very bad experience with Flipkart and Lenevo K3 note.
-Lenevo`s UI & OS takes up a lot of RAM, upto 1 GB at all times.
-Phone is slow and takes random reboots.
-Wifi is not working since day 1, since 296 MB update.
-Reported this issue to Flipkart and asked for a return, and they arranged for a call with one of their "expert" and she told me that phone is working fine and wifi is also working while this phone won`t detect any wifi network and can`t use the phone as a wifi hot-spot. Flipkart asked me to take this phone to service center and did not provide a replacement.
-Touch screen is OK.
-battery backup is not that good, more is expected from 2900 MaH battery.
-Flipkart delivery took 7 days and multiple followups to deliver the phone.
-Best Full HD budget mobile
-Good Display
-Camera is very good in day light
-No Over Heating (Max Temperature i found was 42 degrees after playing Asplalt 8)
-Good UI (better than waht i expected)
-GOOD SOUND
-Camera is not so good in Low Light
-Slow charging (it takes 2 hours of time to charge completely when running apps are closed)
-Asphalt 8 lags in High Graphics mode
-NO PROTECTIVE SCREEN
-good phone with some manageable quirks
-i have both a7000 and k3 ...what i notice is that screen color is more towards the colder side in k3 i.e white will look more like bluish white in this.( i would have preferred more neutral tone but screen clarity and viewing angle is awesome)
-charging time is a big problem. (battery 2900)
-speaker sound is shit in both the phone...u will find problem to hear the voice through the phone earpiece if u are at some busy place.(call quality is less on our side)
-ram available is less in k3 compared to a7000.(though this never affected the performance)
-network signal strength in a7000 and k3 is comparatively less than the other phones it fluctuates a lot which never happened with my moto g or samsung basic phone.(but again till now i dont have face any problem of no network but consider this fact also that i live in central mumbai )
-so just take this things into consideration.....no doubt this is a good phone for the price we are paying but it can be better if they would have included fast charging and better earpiece
-Chat applications NOT working
-Thought it would b great. But it dissapointed!!!
-Chat applications (Messenger, WhatsApp, WeChat, etc) are not working!!! Could not initialise WhatsApp... If I send a message through Messenger intended person is not getting that message!!! What the HELL!!!!!!!!
-Contacted with Vodafone customer care but they are saying services are not blocked, so may be an issue of WhatsApp and Messenger. Then contacted with WhatsApp they are saying to ask Vodafone for internet settings.
-Has anybody faced this issue earlier???
-BUDGET
-Few POINTS noted after using this phone which is not there in product description:
-LENOVO K50a40 is INDIAN version of K3 note
-Camera quality is good as per budget but if we compare to Samsung Galaxy S4/S5 or MI 4I, then it lacks in various terms
-No Headphones or Back cover
-Screen guard is not upto the mark
-Battery is 2900 MaH, but it drains immediately after few hours usage. Need to charge twice a day
-User interface is good, text and images are crisp & clear
-Dolby Atmos is an app like you download other apps from store just to improve music quality
-Go for it if you don't wants to spend more money on other PHABETS
-Product returned, waiting to book a replacement...
-This is my first mobile of Moto (I own an HTC 516 and my brother has a Moto E, and he has faced no problem with that till now. *Touchwood*). My first experience was good. The initial set up took some time but the function was smooth and not sluggish. Obviously I bought this for the features and my first check was the camera.
-Both the front and rear camera quality is great. I took a few snaps with the front camera with dimmed lighting and it came out nice. Overall think the phone stands up to whatever is said about it.
-Don't wanna repeat the specs and give a boring comment on that. But think in this price range Moto has really given a good phone with good features.
-And it seems all what I said is bouncing back on me and hitting me hard.
-The video playback is sluggish and when I contacted the Moto help thru their online facility, the person said that it will be recurring and I need to follow a list of steps to clear cache on the phone.
-Now if the problem is recurring, they why can't they service the mobile? Or give a replacement?
-Visited the Moto Service center.
-They said software needs to be updated.
-Put up my case to Flipkart and they have taken my mobile back and given a refund.
-Good Product from Motorola
-Performance
-Storage
-Water resistant
-Unremovable battery
-Battery- Samsung(3000mah)
-Water resistant- Moto G3(plus point)
-Now talking about specs, while both are almost identical, Moto G3 handles games better with no lag and heating because of its UI(heats up a little when on charge), while touchwiz uses up a lot of RAM which leaves about 500-800 Ram for other apps..it can only hold 4 apps while Moto G3 can hold 18 apps with ease!
-Now Now there are small things like slight price difference,dual flash,front facing flash,4G LTE but thats up to you..
-In conclusion i'll give Moto G3 8.5 and Samsung J5 an 8.
-If you want better resolutions,selfies and more battery life, go for the J5.
-these phones are simply the best in range right now
-Motorolla really learned how to make a good phone
-I bought moto g 1st gen on first day of its release (Feb6th 2013) and moto g3 also i bought on first day itself.
-Motorola delivers on fronts which really matters. No bells and whistles, pure performance. If you want a iPhone like phone in android at low cost moto is the go to phone.
-Moto G3 Usability
-My review is completely based on usability.
-Multitasking is very fluent with all basic social networking running backend.
-Screen clarity is good with 300 ppi approx. for a 5 inch mobile..
-Stock android L experience is great.
-Both front and rear camera captures good snaps. Specially brightness/saturation is added appropriately to the pics taken from selfie cam.
-Call clarity at both end is very good.
-Water resistance is added advantage.
-Built quality is very sturdy . Feels mobile is much secured and good while holding it in hands due to its back grip cover.
-Graphics and quadCore performance is nice, I have played Asphalt 8 and mortal kombat and it runs fluently.
-Battery backup is very good, it almost gives a whole day backup with wifi/3G on and normal usage.
-Mobile stays little warm all the time compared to other mobile. I am not sure if this isuue is common or specific to my mobile. Waiting for other reviews
-Great phone
-After a long gap I have purchased motorola phone. For 3 years i have been using samsung phones. And to be frank samsung phones suck. They are slow, hang up and heat up despite claiming good specs. I had grand 2 before motorola g3 and from day one I had heating issues, poor battery back up and despite 1.5 gb ram, grand 2 was slow.
-But when i compare the new motorola phone, oh boy, it is fast and responsive.
-Touch is very responsive and fast
-Absolutely no lag (13 apps loaded so far). Samsung Grand 2 used to hang up.
-No heating issues. (Samsung grand 2 used to get heated up like an oven)
-Battery seems to last for good 10 hours with mobile data or wifi on
-Phone feels light in hand/pocket and the ergonomics is great.
-The back panel looks premium and gives a nice grip in hand
-4g connectivity is great
-Call sound quality is crisp and clear
-Camera is super fast (samsung camera is like a snail)
-Water resistant feature is great though i haven't yet tested.
-Jet black screen oozes beauty
-Non-removable battery
-I found UI of samsung more friendly but this is not really a con and may be i am not used to motorola UI
-Good and Awesome
-I got the product with in less than 12hrs.
-I like the Design and Camera.
-Its pure Android OS, Such a smooth and Fast OS.
-Frame is Fiber but not metal.
-Except all good.
-Thank you Flipkart and MOTO.
-My next review after one month of usage of this product.
-Good Upgrade from G2
-First of all, super fast delivery! I ordered the phone at around 1130am and was unboxing it by 4pm on the same day!
-Secondly, I exchanged my old Moto G1 for this Phone, so got a great discount too.
-It is a great phone for it's price range and that is what made me hang on to my Moto G1 until now, when I found I the right upgrade.
-As of now, I got a chance to test the camera and the pictures have come out great both in low light and during the day.
-The flash upgrade has helped.
-The phone is fast and apps do not have any lag.
-I used to face a lag for certain large games on he G1 but don't seem to face any of that on this phone yet.
-Would recommend this phone to anyone any day.
-My only concern is that flipkart could have taken the old phone after a day (as they charge you for pickup anyway) as it would have given a chance to try out moto migrate between the two phones.
-certified buyer
-Buy it for a smooth experience, not for flaunting specs
-I have updated my experience after 5 days of usage at the bottom.
-I have been using an Xperia (high end) and shifted to Moto G3.
-I am a moderate intensity user with majority usage in communication apps. No major gaming usage. As soon as Moto G3 was released, I realized the specifications are perfect for me. Also, it is very important to judge overall stability of the product rather than just specifications. If high spec hardware is not tuned properly, then desired usage experience can not be achieved. Considering previous Moto G model performances, I decided to buy this, even if similar or better specs are available in the market at lower price.
-Size, Build 5 inch screen is perfect for me and there are not many options available in the market. The phone is handy, with good build quality.
-Back cover finishing is nice and gives grip.
-Though the back lid is not fitted with finesse and also, plastic film in the top speaker lacks fine finishing. But acceptable for this price range.
-Resolution I am happy with 720p. Having full HD just for sake of it at the cost of battery does not make sense. Display is clear and vibrant. No complaints. Touch performance is smooth, does not miss any touches.
-Performance  Did not have any lags in any activity.
-However I am yet to put pressure on phone. 2 GB RAM supports the phone adequately. Somebody is comparing this phone with Moto E just based on processor, and it is hilarious.
-Battery I charged it full yesterday, used it for 1:30 hrs non-stop. Woke up today morning and used it moderately for 6 hours and it is showing 52%. Good battery performance.
-Camera It is better than previous Moto G versions.
-It is better than many peers in the market. But it is not something which will blow your mind.
-Front camera is decent too.
-Audio Call quality is good. Music sound quality in speakers is loud enough and clear.
-Accessories Charger comes with dual USB ports. But takes some time to charge. Headphone are
-Next level of perfection to Moto Generation.
-I was initially thinking to buy other phone, but when i heard about upcoming Moto G3 release, waited for launch and i am so much happy that it really worth waiting this phone.
-The phone is just awesome:-
-Camera both front and back are really good in taking pictures.
-Sound Quality is superb.
-No boltware apps, simple smoot UI.
-More than 1 GB of Ram available, so no lags even while multitasking and gaming.
-Good design and grip for holding phone in your hands, superb call quality.
-Both sim supports 4G.
-No cons till now and thanks flipkart for faster and well packed delivery.
-Just suggest everyone to go for this phone, as it is next level of perfection to moto generation.
